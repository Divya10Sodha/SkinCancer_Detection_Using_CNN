## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- The objective of this assignment is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect the melanoma skin disease and classify the images into 9 types:-
    1. actinic keratosis
    2. basal cell carcinoma
    3. dermatofibroma
    4. melanoma
    5. nevus
    6. pigmented benign keratosis
    7. seborrheic keratosis
    8. squamous cell carcinoma
    9. vascular lesion
- This is an attempt to build a solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma,  which may have the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- The final model uses the dropout layer and batch normalization and is able to prevent some level of overfitting
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameters.
